### Models

1. `/SVC/Project2_Final_Model.ipynb`: Notebook for Linear SVC model predictions. Predictions used for one of the final Kaggle submissions.

2. `/NaiveBayes/Project2NaiveBayes.ipynb`: Notebook for Naive Bayes model. Predictions used for one of the final Kaggle submissions.

3. `/MLP/Project_2_Limited_Data.ipynb`: Notebook for MLP model. Model is discussed in the report, but was not use for the final Kaggle submission.

4. `/RNN/Project2RNN.ipynb`: Notebook for RNN model. Model was not used in report or final Kaggle submissions.

**Final submissions to competition were from Naive Bayes and Linear SVC models**

Feature engineering and/or problem transformations for each model are contained in the notebook. Naive Bayes and SVC notebooks also include testing performed on alternative problem transformations discussed in the report.

*Note: Notebooks for Naive Bayes, SVC, and RNN loads the data from CSV, but MLP loads the data from the original JSON file.*
